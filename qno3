qno3 : Explain the difference between the if-elif-else and nested if-else structures.
Ans : The if-elif-else structure allows for multiple conditional branches to be evaluted in sequence. Python checks each condition in order, and if one of them is true,
it executes the corresponding block of code and then exits the entire structure. If none of the connditions are true, the code block associated with the else statement (if present)
is executed.

On the other hand, nested if-else structures involve placing one if-else structure inside another. This allows for more complex decisions-making scenarios, where conditions might depend
on the outcome pof previous conditions. Each nested if-else structure is evaluted independantly based on its own condition.

In summary, if-elif-else is useful when you have multiple exclusive conditions to check, while nested if-else structure are suitable for handling more intricate decision-making
scenarios where conditions may be independent.
