qno2 : How does python determine which block of code to execute in an if-else statement?
Ans : In an if-else statement in python, the condition specified after the if keyword is evaluted. If the condition is true, the block of code immediately following the 
if statement is executed. If the condition is false, the block of code following the else statement (if present) is executed. So, python determines whuch block of code to 
execute based on truth value of the condition specified in the if statement.
