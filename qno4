qno4 : How can you use logical operators(and,or,not) with if-else staements in python?
Ans : In python, logical operators(and,or,not) can be used to combine multiple conditions witin an if statement to make more complex condition checks.
and : This opeartor returns True if both conditions on its left and right sides are true.
or : This operator returns True if at least one of the conditions on its left or right side is true.
not : This operator negates the truth value of the condition following it.

Here's an example of how you can use these operators with if-else statements:

x = 5
y = 10

if x > 0 and y < 15:
    print("Both conditions are true")

if x == 0 or y == 5:
    print("At least one condition is true")

if not x == 0:
    print("x is not equal to 0")
else:
    print("x is equal to 0")
